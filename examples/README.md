# Examples

Getting doctests working for this sort of crate is difficult at best. Therefore, these examples
serve as documentation as to how the latest version of the `doko` macro works. For the time being,
they also serve as integration tests to ensure the library still functions as intented.

## Usage

```zsh
% cargo run --example <args|demo|deep|euler|multiargs>
```
